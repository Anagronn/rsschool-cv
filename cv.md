## | SUMMARY

I started learning programming with **C** and **C++** at the uni, and then I studied a bit of machine learning with **Python** and **object-oriented** programming in **Java**. 
From this semester, at the university, I switched to JavaScript and now have desire to develop in the area of frontend development.

I am ready to devote a large amount of time to learning and solving a wide range of problems; I quickly absorb information and wisely treat failures.
